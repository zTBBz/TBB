## Traveler's Bag Build or Mod-Union (TBB) ##
<div align="left">
<img src="./images/Info.png" width=35%/>
</div>

Mod-Union is a big project, it will include MTP and SMaD, as well as all new mods under my authorship. All mods become Mod-Union modules with great relative autonomy. That is, Mod-Union can update only one module for each update and it will be indicated which module was updated and, of course, what exactly was updated. 

<div align="left">
<img src="./images/Progress.png" width=35%/>
</div>

Current priority:
1.  Moving main content of SMaD and MTP to new version of RogueLibs. SMaD - 17,39% and MTP - 23,91%.
2.  Make normal custom status effects for SMaD. Search pixel-artist for items sprites.
3.  Refactoring desc. traits for MTP. Search pixel-artist for traits sprites.

1.  When will Mod-Union be released????
    1.  Well, the work continues. The Mod-Union beta will be released soon, you will be able to look at the progress and some new features.

2.  Why aren't SMaD and MTP updated?
    1.  SMaD and MTP are updated. Just on their pages on GameBanana and on GitHub, they will not be updated.

3.  I started playing multiplayer with Mod-Union, but something doesn't work, how fix?
    1.  This is normal, the mod is intended only for single-player play, like all mods at the moment.

4.  I downloaded Mod-Union, but I have all the items and everything else without names, or they just don't exist, how fix?
    1.  Check the correct installation, your version of the game, you have installed [Networking DLL Fix](https://discord.com/channels/187414758536773632/433748059172896769/764059349000781874)

5.  I've seen SMaD sprites - they're terrible, I'm a pixel artist can I help?
